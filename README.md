# atm-project

This project simulates the function of an ATM machine. If you choose the 'Deposit' option you can put in as much money as you like. 
When you choose the 'Cash Back' option you can only take out as much as has already been deposited. 
Unfortunately the amount you withdraw will not appear in your real bank account.

This project highlights the useState functionality of React. This allows the program to keep track of the values whenever something changes.

To use this program:

1. Start http-server
2. Open Index.html on Localhost
